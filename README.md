- 👋 Hi, I’m @feyzijan
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning with sci-kit and Keras, and working on some finance projects

- I am currently in the process of organising my past work and putting it all together in this repository

- Some of my latest projects won't be in here a while as I need to wait for a class to finish before making my private repos public.
