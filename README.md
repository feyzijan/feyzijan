- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @feyzijan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science and machine learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing a masters in Computational Data Analytics in Georgia Tech
- I am currently in the process of organising my past work and putting it all together in this repository

- Some of my course related projects won't be in here a while as I need to wait for a class to finish before making my private repos public.
